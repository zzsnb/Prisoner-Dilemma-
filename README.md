**A website app to imitate prisoner dilemma tournament.(a CS50 Final Project)**

There is a famous game in Game theory named The Prisoner's Dilemma([Introduction to Prisoner's Dilemma in Wikipeida ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma)), which is about two prisoners choose to cooperate or betray. And in the last century, a professor in America held a tournament to collect strategies from game theorists from all over the world.This website is to immitate the tournament.

This project includes two part, you can not only play with GUI, but also play with CLI by download the app_ui.py in [Github](https://github.com/zzsnb/Prisoners-Dilemma). Actually, there were some mature projects like [Prisoner's dilemma from thabbott](https://github.com/thabbott/prisoners-dilemma) and [Prisoner's dilemma from Axelrod](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod). But there was no website satisfactory enough.

This website's goal is to provide a simple GUI game for students and teachers who study the Game theory.

The website is develped with flask and bootstrap. There are 3 modes: single player, two players and multiple players. The 3 modes provide different pages. In single player mode, you can play with the computer. In single and two players mode, you can choose turn by turn, but in multiple players mode, you can only choose strategies.

I may add a function which allows people to add strategies by themselves(use a python frame).(Not Done.)

At last, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation for David J. Malan and all stuff who work for CS50. You provide such a gorgeous course to the world.
